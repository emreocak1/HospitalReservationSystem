There are 6 doctors. The last 2 ones(Stephen Curry, Kobe Bryant) was created as real users and assigned as doctors.
In those accounts, you can see the appointments that created by patients, if the patients made their appointments from these doctors.
The other doctors were created as examples and they do not have accounts.
In the contact us page, submit button is not functional, and was created as an example.
You can add doctors in the admin panel, but if you want doctors to be real accounts, you register the page first and then assign doctor role in the admin panel. It automatically makes the account doctor and list the user as a doctor.
